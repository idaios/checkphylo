Checks a phylogenetics tree and alignment for consistency

The goal is to check a phylogenetics tree if it produces data that
have similar summary statistics values as the real ones that were used
to make the tree. I just suspect that the output tree of a
phylogenetics analysis, it might be the best tree, but it also and
simultaneously it might be a bad tree actually.

As a dataset, I'll examine the language tree since the dataset is
actually quite small and easy to manipulate.
